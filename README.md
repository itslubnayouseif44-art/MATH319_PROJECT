# MATH319_PROJECT

🔐 academic Project description

This project was developed as part of the requirements for Cryptography and Coding Theory course ( MATH 319). 
The main goal is to apply core cryptographic concepts in a practical way by building a secure file-storage system using Python. 
The project focuses on connecting the theoretical ideas taught in the course with real implementation methods used in modern security systems.---

🔎 Key cryptographic concepts used

1.🔑 hash functions (SHA-256)

2.🛡️ symmetric encryption (AES-based Fernet)

3.🧬 key generation & management

4.🔐 user authentication
